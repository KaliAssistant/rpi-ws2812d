# ws2812d.conf — configuration for rpi-ws2812d
#
# This file controls how the WS2812d daemon behaves.
# Lines beginning with '#' are comments.
#
# Sections:
#   [gpio] — GPIO settings
#   [spi]  — SPI settings
#   [user] — User LED settings
#
# Options:
#   power_pin   : BCM GPIO number used to enable LED power (must be valid in available_pwr_gpio[]).
#   spi_freq    : SPI clock frequency in Hz (typical 2.4–3.3 MHz works for WS2812).
#   leds_count  : Number of WS2812/NeoPixel LEDs connected.
#   delay_us    : Polling delay in microseconds between shared memory checks (e.g. 2000 = 2ms).
#
# Default search path: /etc/ws2812d/ws2812d.conf
# To override, run: ws2812d -c /path/to/config.conf
#

[gpio]
# Power control GPIO (BCM numbering).
# Example: 11 = GPIO11
power_pin=11

[spi]
# SPI frequency in Hz (try 2400000 or 3300000)
spi_freq=3300000

[user]
# Number of WS2812 LEDs in your strip
leds_count=1

# Polling delay in microseconds (2000 = 2ms)
delay_us=2000
